[Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation](https://mushokutensei.fandom.com/wiki/Mushoku_Tensei_Wiki)
---
Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation stands out as a refreshing and innovative take on the isekai formula.
The story of Mushoku Tensei revolves around Rudeus Greyrat who was a 34-year-old NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) in his previous life.

He is flawed and doesnâ€™t care about anyone, including his parents. He even misses their funeral and is eventually thrown out of the house. But one fateful evening, he decides to sacrifice his life for a stranger, which leads to his untimely death. Fortunately, he is reincarnated in a magical world with his memories and personality intact. 

He is reincarnated as a newborn baby with the mind of a 34-year-old.
The art style of Mushoku Tensei is spectacular and unlike anything we have ever seen in other isekai series.

Mushoku Tensei stands out from its counterparts with its pastel shades, lighting, and painting-like character designs.
The stunning execution of these techniques creates a very film-like series, which is highly immersive for fans.

The use of colors and lighting in most parts of the series are quite moody, but they showcase magic breathtakingly.
Whenever a magic spell is cast, the colors burst forth, albeit not sharply. They maintain a moody pastel tone, but they shine and evoke excitement in the viewer.

The essence of Mushoku Tensei centers on love, primarily focusing on the characters discovering their sense of belonging within a family.
It delves deep into the intricate dynamics of familial relationships, encompassing themes of resilience and personal development.

Mushoku Tensei does exceptionally well in showing the not-so-good side of people, but it leaves room for the characters to grow and acknowledge their mistakes.
